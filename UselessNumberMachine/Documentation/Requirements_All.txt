1)	The input shall be a list of non-zero real numbers. 
1.1) 	The list shall be limited to a maximum of 10 numbers
	Rationale: With smaller data sets, optimization and efficiency are not primary concerns.
1.2)	The system shall accept a single list of non-zero real numbers.  
1.3)	The system shall accept a plain-text file of lists of non-zero real numbers.
2)	There shall be a CLI, GUI, and a plain-text output file.
2.1)	The CLI and GUI shall produce output in accordance to requirement 3 for a single list of non-zero real numbers.
2.2)	The CLI and GUI shall inform the user of the creation of a plain-text output file.
2.2.1)	The Useless Number Machine shall not provide direct means of evaluating the plain-text output file.
3) 	The output shall consist of the following:
	- input ordered by value
	- addition computation
	- subtraction computation
	- multiplication computation
	- division computation
	- modulus 
	- reciprocal addition computation
	- reciprocal subtraction computation
	- reciprocal multiplication computation
	- reciprocal division computation
	- greatest common divisor
	- least common multiple
	- largest number
	- smallest number
	- mean
	- median
	- mode
	- variance
	- standard deviation
	- prime numbers
	- Mersenne prime numbers
	- exponential
	- square root of sum
	- sum of square roots
	- square root of difference
	- difference of square roots
	- square root of product
	- product of square roots
	- square root of quotient
	- quotient of square roots
	- (sum of input)^2
	- sum of (input^2)
	- (difference of input)^2
	- difference of (input^2)
	- (product of input)^2
	- product of (input^2)
	- (quotient of input)^2
	- quotient of (input^2)
4)	Decimal formatting is as follows: 
	x.0 	=> x
	x.y0 	=> x.y
	x.yy0	=> x.yy
	x.yyy0	=> x.yyy
	x.yyyyy => x.yyyy
	0.0000y => 0
4.1)	If rounding up causes the rightmost digit to become 0, that zero will not be eliminated.
5)	Significant figures are not used as accuracy is not the goal of this software.
